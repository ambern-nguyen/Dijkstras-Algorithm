# Dijkstras-Algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using a graph of vertices and weighted edges. Graph class contains functions needed to construct graph data structure: add/remove vertex, add/remove edges, use Dijkstra's to identify length of the shortest path between nodes, and a function that identifies the vertices visited in the shortest path.
